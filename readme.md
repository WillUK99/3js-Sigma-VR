# SIGMA VR - Fictional Metaverse/VR experience

https://sigma-vr.vercel.app/

This is a fictional VR experience landing page for the company 'SIGMA', with sleek animations, Three.JS interactivity and eye catching design.

## The Design
When I initally thought about creating this landing page I knew it had to stand out in more ways than one. The design of this landing page is sleek and minimal, taking inspiration from a handful of Awwwards sites https://www.awwwards.com/. 

I noticed that a common theme recently is dark backgrounds and a bright primary colour, with splashes of the same primary colour dotted around the page, resulting in the large oversized background text which can be seen in each section of the page. 

Font also was crucial in giving a feeling of old meets new, with both fonts used being a stark contract to each other. 

## The 3D 
I have been learning about Three.JS and WebGL prior to creating this SIGMA experience. From making cubes and basic lighting to a 3D Helicoid which can be seen here https://3js-hyperbolic-helicoid-jlqu8gpss-willuk99.vercel.app/, the whole learning process has been extensively rewarding along side my other learnings of React, Node.JS. 

The main Three.JS component was a great learning experience, teaching me many principles of 3D computer graphics and how to use WebGL from passing in uniforms to wave functions to alter the vertex and fragment shaders. 

## The conclusion
To conclude this was a great learning experience, I was able to learn a great deal about Three.js and WebGL, as well as flex my designing muscles and also the sleek animations you can see to create something I am truly proud of. The main crux of the project was the torus like object that rises on the page load (thanks to the GSAP I implemented). 

Furthermore some of the CSS was a bit tricky to get in place at times, especially the lower sections of the site. However I am thrilled with the results, and I can't wait to continue learning more and more about these great techs.

Next stop React and Node!!
